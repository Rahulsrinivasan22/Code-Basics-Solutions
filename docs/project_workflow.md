# Codebasics Project 11: Lok Sabha Election Analytics â€” Project Workflow & Analytical Summary

## Executive Summary

This project undertakes a comprehensive electoral data analysis of the Lok Sabha elections for the years 2014 and 2019. Leveraging advanced SQL techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and aggregations, the project delivers actionable insights on voter turnout patterns, party dominance, vote share dynamics, and electoral competitiveness across constituencies and states.

## Business Questions & Analytical Approach

### 1. Voter Turnout Analysis: Top and Bottom Constituencies & States

* **Objective:** Identify constituencies and states with the highest and lowest voter turnout ratios for 2014 and 2019.
* **Method:** Aggregate total votes and electors per constituency and state; compute turnout ratios; rank and filter top/bottom performers.
* **Outcome:** Enables electoral stakeholders to pinpoint engagement disparities and target voter awareness campaigns.

### 2. Party Consistency and Vote Share Ranking

* **Objective:** Determine constituencies where the same party was elected consecutively in 2014 and 2019, ranked by their vote share in 2019.
* **Method:** Join election results across years on constituency and party; filter top-ranked parties by vote counts; calculate vote percentage dominance.
* **Outcome:** Assesses party loyalty and electoral strongholds, critical for campaign strategy and resource allocation.

### 3. Electoral Swing: Constituencies with Party Changes & Vote Share Differentials

* **Objective:** Identify constituencies that switched winning parties between 2014 and 2019, ranked by vote share difference.
* **Method:** Compare top-ranked parties per constituency across elections; compute vote share changes to capture swing magnitude.
* **Outcome:** Highlights volatile regions and potential battlegrounds for focused electoral interventions.

### 4. Candidate Competitiveness: Top Margins of Victory

* **Objective:** Extract candidates with the largest margins over their nearest runners-up in both elections.
* **Method:** Rank candidates by total votes per constituency; compute and rank margins of victory.
* **Outcome:** Reveals candidates with strong mandate, useful for political profiling and election forecasting.

### 5. National & State-Level Party Vote Share Distribution

* **Objective:** Quantify party-wise vote share percentages at national and state levels for both election years.
* **Method:** Aggregate party votes relative to total votes nationally and per state; calculate and rank percentage splits.
* **Outcome:** Supports party performance evaluation and regional dominance insights.

### 6. Party Vote Share Dynamics: Gains and Losses Between 2014 & 2019

* **Objective:** Identify top constituencies where major parties (e.g., BJP, Congress) gained or lost vote share.
* **Method:** Compute vote share per party per constituency for both years; calculate differences and rank gains/losses.
* **Outcome:** Delivers granular insights on electoral momentum shifts critical for campaign recalibration.

## Technical Workflow & Innovations

* **Data Preparation:** Consolidated results datasets from 2014 and 2019 with attention to total votes, electors, party affiliations, and candidate details.
* **Advanced SQL Constructs:** Utilized CTEs for modular query logic; window functions for intra-group ranking; and precise casting for percentage calculations ensuring data integrity.
* **Performance Optimization:** Minimized redundant computations by leveraging indexed joins and partitioned ranking.
* **Scalability:** Designed queries adaptable for future election cycles and extended to multi-level aggregation (national, state, constituency).
* **Result Validation:** Cross-verified vote totals and turnout ratios with official electoral commission reports to ensure data accuracy.
